      <p>
        I am <strong>Rishi Ranjan Tripathy</strong>, an electrical engineer in the making, driven by a strong
        interest in power systems, power electronics and automation. I enjoy understanding how things
        work from the inside and using that knowledge to design smarter and more reliable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career objective is to gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge research and development in
        the field of electrical engineering, while contributing my knowledge and technical skills
        towards meaningful innovation and sustainable energy systems.

    <p class="section-subtitle">From village roots to a global learning mindset.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I spent the first 13 years of my life in my village, where I completed my education till 6th
        class. That period shaped my values, discipline and connection with people and nature.
        Afterwards, I moved to <strong>Odagaon</strong> for one year to study in 7th class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I shifted to <strong>Bhubaneswar</strong> and continued my schooling at
        <strong>Saraswati Shishu Vidya Mandir, Niladri Vihar</strong>, where I studied in 8th, 9th and 10th
        standards and passed my 10th Board with <strong>80% marks</strong>. From there, my journey into
        electrical engineering truly began.
