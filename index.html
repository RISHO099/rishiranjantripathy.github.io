        <h3>Childhood & Early Education</h3>
        <p>
          I lived 13 years in my village and studied there up to 6th class. After that I spent one year
          in Odagaon for my 7th class. Later, I moved to Bhubaneswar and continued my schooling at
          Saraswati Shishu Vidya Mandir, Niladri Vihar, completing 8th, 9th and 10th with 80% marks.
